A simple GUI editor for JSON files for V Rising mods made with [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore) and [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri).

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> You might get a prompt saying "Windows has protected your PC". In this case, click `More Info` and `Run Anyway`. _(It costs a LOT of money to get a certificate for applications.)_

> [!TIP]
> If you're unsure about the safety of this app, I would suggest running it through a service like [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com).

## Supported Mods
- Generic JSONs
Rising will attempt to procedurally generate a GUI for any unknown JSON files given to it. This is useful for mods that don't have official support for JSON Rising.
